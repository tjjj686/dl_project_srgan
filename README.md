# Implementation of Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network(SRGAN)

The dataset will be CelebA, which can be download at http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html

To run the program on colab, please download the dataset and upload locally.

The model we use is based on the 
*"Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network"*
https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802


## Summary
In this project, We will look at how to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution ones by using SRGAN. SRGAN is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4Ã— upscaling factors. In this project, we will show how well it can be applied in the CelebA dataset. Also, we will take more challenging task with  8x upscalling task.
